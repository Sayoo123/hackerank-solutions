For this problem, we have  types of queries you can perform on a List:

Insert  at index :

Insert
x y
Delete the element at index :

Delete
x
Given a list,L, of N integers, perform  queries on the list. Once all queries are completed, print the modified list as a single line of space-separated integers.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, N (the initial number of elements in L).
The second line contains  N space-separated integers describing L.
The third line contains an integer, Q (the number of queries).
The 2Q  subsequent lines describe the queries, and each query is described over two lines:

If the first line of a query contains the String Insert, then the second line contains two space separated integers , and the value  must be inserted into  at index .
If the first line of a query contains the String Delete, then the second line contains index , whose element must be deleted from .
Constraints



Each element in is a 32-bit integer.
Output Format

Print the updated list  as a single line of space-separated integers.

Sample Input

5
12 0 1 78 12
2
Insert
5 23
Delete
0
Sample Output

0 1 78 12 23

Explanation

Insert 23 at index .

 Delete the element at index .

Having performed all  queries, we print  as a single line of space-separated integers.
